# Classification Stellar Variability with SVM or RF and PCA and/or NMF

The work consist in classify images from the High Cadence Transient Survey (HiTS) project, that is trying to find transient event that occurs during the first instants of a supernova.

The dataset has 100.000 samples with 3 images from each samples, the size of these images is 21x21. The two classes of images to classify are: transient candidates associated to stellar variability (true or positive class) and transient candidates associated to cosmic rays, and artifacts (false or negative class). The next figure shows examples of neagtice and positive class.
